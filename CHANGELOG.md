## [0.2.1](https://github.com/Indemnity83/logistics/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1) (2026-01-14)


### Bug Fixes

* correct item passthrough pipe recipe ([#18](https://github.com/Indemnity83/logistics/issues/18)) ([f65f489](https://github.com/Indemnity83/logistics/commit/f65f489fafed4ca6c575c4feb8ab3e2360355d58))

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/Indemnity83/logistics/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) (2026-01-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Quartz pipes no longer output comparator signals. Existing item sensor pipes will automatically resolve to copper transport pipes when loading older worlds.

### Features

* add item passthrough pipe for inventory bypass ([#17](https://github.com/Indemnity83/logistics/issues/17)) ([487cabb](https://github.com/Indemnity83/logistics/commit/487cabba6aa8d99c70461f280c1a433dfc7e4426))
* add quartz pipe inventory overflow behavior ([#16](https://github.com/Indemnity83/logistics/issues/16)) ([5e9b51b](https://github.com/Indemnity83/logistics/commit/5e9b51badd130c6ba01e2821dfee87242f2fce9c))


### Bug Fixes

* remove invalid property references from pipe blockstates ([#14](https://github.com/Indemnity83/logistics/issues/14)) ([a621f05](https://github.com/Indemnity83/logistics/commit/a621f0560f8b2628fa9faaf262033773552552cb))
