## ⚠️ Early Development

**Logistics is in active development.** Core pipe transport works, but expect rough edges, missing features, and the occasional bug. Report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/indemnity83/logistics/issues) if something breaks.

## About

Logistics is a Fabric mod inspired by BuildCraft and Logistics Pipes, bringing authentic item pipe systems to modern Minecraft. Items travel smoothly through thin pipes with visible motion, integrating seamlessly with other mods via Fabric's Transfer API.

**Design Principles:**
- **Material-Based Identity** - Each pipe uses distinct vanilla materials for visual clarity
- **Layered Progression** - Three tiers: Mechanical pipes (basic operations), Smart pipes (decisions), Network logistics (abstract services)
- **Authentic Visuals** - Items travel continuously through pipes with visible speed
- **Mod Interoperability** - Works with any mod using Fabric Transfer API (ItemStorage)
- **Classic Ergonomics** - Simple placement, visible connections, easy to understand

---

## How It Works

Logistics is built on a **three-tier system** that grows with your world progression. Implemented tiers are listed first, followed by future plans.

### Tier 1: Mechanical Pipes (Implemented)
**Basic routing without item awareness**

Start here. These pipes perform mechanical operations—moving, merging, extracting, deleting—but they don't look at what's flowing through them. They just do their job, every time, regardless of item type.

- **Stone Transport Pipe (Stone)** - Very slow backbone connectivity with random routing
- **Copper Transport Pipe (Copper)** - Backbone connectivity with random routing
- **Item Extractor Pipe (Wood)** - Pull items from adjacent inventories into your network
- **Item Merger Pipe (Iron)** - All inputs converge to a single output
- **Golden Transport Pipe (Gold)** - Speed boost when powered by redstone
- **Item Passthrough Pipe (Sandstone)** - Connects only to pipes; bypasses inventories
- **Item Void Pipe (Obsidian)** - Delete unwanted items

### Tier 2: Smart Pipes (Implemented)
**Item-aware routing decisions**

These pipes are intelligent. They inspect items and change behavior based on what they see. This is where your network becomes conditional and responsive.

- **Item Filter Pipe (Diamond)** - Route specific items to specific destinations (item-aware)
- **Item Insertion Pipe (Quartz)** - Prefer inventories with space; otherwise route to pipes

### Tier 3: Network Logistics (Future)
**System-aware automation and requests**

The ultimate goal. Your inventories become abstract resources, and you request what you need—the network figures out the rest.

- **Request Tables** - Ask for items; the network delivers them
- **Provider Modules** - Advertise what inventories contain
- **Crafting Logistics** - Automated crafting on demand
- **Global Routing** - Smart pathfinding across your entire network

Each tier builds on the previous one—you'll use all three together as your base grows.

## Pipes & Tools

### Stone Transport Pipe (Stone)
Early transport pipe that moves items through your network at a very slow speed. When an item reaches a junction with multiple outputs, it randomly selects a direction. Pipes have a small internal capacity (about five items), so slow pipes can drop items if your early network gets too busy.

*Recipe: stone + glass → 8 pipes*

### Copper Transport Pipe (Copper)
Basic transport pipe that moves items through your network. When an item reaches a junction with multiple outputs, it randomly selects a direction. This is your backbone—simple, reliable connectivity.

*Recipe: copper ingot + glass → 8 pipes*

Mark copper pipes with **marking fluid** (water bottle + dye) to segment networks by color. Pipes with the same marking will not connect; sneak + empty hand clears the marking.

### Item Extractor Pipe (Wood)
Extraction pipe that actively pulls items from an adjacent inventory into your pipe network. Right-click with a wrench to select which face extracts. Only one face can be active at a time. Wooden pipes extract one item per operation.

*Recipe: planks + glass → 8 pipes*

### Item Merger Pipe (Iron)
Merger pipe that takes items from any input direction and routes them all to a single output direction. The output is indicated by an opaque connector. Right-click with a wrench to change the output direction. Items cannot enter through the output face.

*Recipe: iron ingot + glass → 8 pipes*

### Golden Transport Pipe (Gold)
Acceleration pipe that speeds up items when powered by redstone. Items passing through a powered gold pipe move faster than normal pipe transit speed.

*Recipe: gold ingot + glass → 8 pipes*

### Item Filter Pipe (Diamond)
Filter pipe that routes items based on configurable per-side filters. Right-click to open a GUI where you can set which item types go to which connected face. Items that don't match any filter are routed to unfiltered outputs. If an item matches no filters and there are no unfiltered directions, the item drops.

*Recipe: diamond + glass → 8 pipes*

### Item Insertion Pipe (Quartz)
Insertion pipe that routes items into connected inventories that will accept them; otherwise it continues them along the pipe network. Items drop if there are no valid outputs.

*Recipe: quartz + glass → 8 pipes*

### Item Passthrough Pipe (Sandstone)
Passthrough pipe that only connects to other pipes and never to inventories. Useful for bypassing inventories or forcing routing around storage.

*Recipe: sandstone + glass → 8 pipes*

### Item Void Pipe (Obsidian)
Deletion pipe that destroys any items that enter it. Items are deleted when they reach the center of the pipe, giving you time to react if needed. Useful for overflow management or disposing of unwanted items.

*Recipe: obsidian + glass + ender pearl → 8 pipes*

### Wrench
Configuration tool for pipes and machines. Right-click to cycle output directions on iron pipes, select extraction faces on wooden pipes, open filter GUIs on diamond pipes, rotate engine output faces, and interact with other configurable blocks.

*Recipe: 4 iron ingots in wrench shape → 1 wrench*

---

## Power

Engines generate RF energy to power automation machines. All engines require a direct redstone signal to run and output energy from one face — use a wrench to rotate which face that is.

### Redstone Engine (Wood)
The simplest engine. Converts a redstone signal into a small, steady energy output. Cannot overheat — safe to run indefinitely.

*Recipe: 3 planks + glass + 2 wooden gears + piston*

### Stirling Engine (Stone)
Burns fuel to generate substantially more energy than a Redstone Engine. Requires both a redstone signal and fuel (coal, charcoal, wood, lava buckets, etc.). Right-click to open the fuel GUI. Temperature rises with use — if the engine overheats it shuts down and must cool before resuming. Sneak + right-click with a wrench to reset from overheat.

*Recipe: 3 stone + glass + 2 stone gears + piston*

---

## Automation

### Laser Quarry
A powered mining machine that excavates a 16×16 area below it. Place it, connect an engine for power, and it automatically builds a frame and mines downward indefinitely. Mined items drop above the quarry — connect pipes to collect them automatically. Energy throughput determines mining speed; a well-fed quarry mines faster.

*Recipe: iron gears + copper gears + diamond gears + diamond pickaxe + redstone*

## Installation

### Requirements
- Minecraft 1.21.11
- Fabric Loader 0.18.4+
- Fabric API
- Java 21+

### Steps
1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for Minecraft 1.21.11
2. Download [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
3. Download Logistics from:
   - [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/indemnity83/logistics/releases) (includes dev builds)
   - [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/logistics) (stable releases)
   - [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/logistics) (stable releases)
4. Place the Fabric API and Logistics `.jar` files in your `.minecraft/mods` folder
5. Launch Minecraft with the Fabric profile

---

## Getting Started

1. **Craft Pipes** — Start with stone or copper pipes for basic transport
2. **Connect to Inventories** — Pipes automatically connect to adjacent chests and other inventories
3. **Extract Items** — Use Item Extractor Pipes to pull items from inventories (wrench to select face)
4. **Control Flow** — Item Merger Pipes for directional routing
5. **Filter Items** — Item Filter Pipes route specific items to specific destinations
6. **Speed Things Up** — Golden Transport Pipes accelerate items when powered by redstone

**Tips:**
- Items drop if they can't find a valid destination
- Use Void pipes to delete overflow or unwanted items
- Item Insertion Pipes prefer inventories with space and otherwise route to pipes
- All pipe tiers connect to each other—build complex networks by combining them
- The wrench is your friend
